# Mamak Food Calories Estimation based on Image Segmentation using Yolov5

Hello! Welcome to my final year project for my degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. In this project, I delve into the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence, showcasing my skills and knowledge gained throughout my academic journey. 

Steps for utilizing this project:

1. Dataset Collection:
- Begin by gathering the dataset relevant to the project you intend to develop.

2. Training:
- If you are using Jupyter Notebook, employ the tutorial.ipynb file to train the model.
- For Google Colab, navigate to the colab folder and utilize the YoloV5_Colab.ipynb file for training.

3. Dashboard Implementation:
- Explore the dashboard prototype located in the segment file.
- Execute the prototype using the run.ipynb file, which will run the underlying prototype.py file, providing you with a hands-on experience of the dashboard functionality.
